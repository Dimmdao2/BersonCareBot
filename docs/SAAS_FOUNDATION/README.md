# SAAS_FOUNDATION — initiative index

**Status:** ⚠️ **REVISION REQUIRED** (plan-review 2026-06-17 — see banner in `CORRECTED_PLAN.md`). Architecture HOLDS (shared-DB+RLS, default-deny, tenant=Organization), but the review (confirmed by DB queries) found: **C-1** scope missed the entire **`integrator` schema** (33 PII tables, 0 org_id) — completeness was on `public`(185) not all **218** tables; **C-3** the "one uniform RLS template" is unimplementable (41/84 tables have no ownership column); **C-2** the chokepoint is T0-weight not a dormant hook; **H-4** default-deny bricks login without an explicit bootstrap-readable tier. **Not ready for P0.1** — revising scope (over public+integrator) + RLS mechanics. 2 owner-decisions pending: integrator org-bridge, catalog/store copy model.
**Goal:** lay the dormant foundation to turn the single-clinic app into a multi-tenant
(multi-specialist / multi-organization), later multi-lingual + multi-region SaaS, with **zero behavior
change** today; turning it on is a controlled cutover, not a flag.

## Documents
**LIVE (read these):** [`CORRECTED_PLAN.md`](CORRECTED_PLAN.md) — **canonical plan** · [`scope-derivation/VERIFIED_SCOPE.md`](scope-derivation/VERIFIED_SCOPE.md) — verified 84-table scope · [`LOG.md`](LOG.md) — execution log.

**History / rationale (superseded by CORRECTED_PLAN where they conflict):**
1. [`00_DECISIONS_AND_SCHEMA.md`](00_DECISIONS_AND_SCHEMA.md) — settled decisions + target schema (Drizzle).
2. [`01_MASTER_PLAN.md`](01_MASTER_PLAN.md) — phases, **Phase 0 stage spine**, critical sizing, **rules-compliance matrix**.
3. [`02_PHASED_BRIEF.md`](02_PHASED_BRIEF.md) — per-stage brief **template** (§12 + §24 compliant) + stage stubs.
4. [`LOG.md`](LOG.md) — mandatory execution log (per `.cursor/rules/plan-authoring-execution-standard`).
5. [`FOUNDATION_PLAN.md`](FOUNDATION_PLAN.md) — **rationale & analysis history** (v1→v3, red-team, grounding). Canonical decisions live in `00_…`; if they conflict, `00_…` wins.

## Canonical decision (one line)
**Cabinet ≡ Organization** (reuse `be_organizations`); specialist = org member; enrollment = Person↔Organization; patient = `platform_users` (no persons-split in Phase 0). Scoping = one context-aware org resolver → request context → Postgres RLS (FORCE + GUC-gated permissive, dormant).

## Workflow (per `.cursor/rules` §24)
Orchestrator (Opus) writes briefs + reviews + integrates; **all implementation → Sonnet subagents**, one stage at a time, own worktree, **no push, no commit to main**, no dev-server, timeouts not infinite waits.
