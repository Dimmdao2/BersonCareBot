-- TEMPORARY LOCAL MIGRATION NUMBER 0305
-- #1069 §2.13: restore the paid-period frozen/live tariff switch lost when 0297
-- removed the four legacy access states. Recreate only the three access readers in their post-0297
-- form: legacy-state removal, signatures, owners, grants, and quota logic remain unchanged.

-- 1. Patient projection: drop the raw column from the read and collapse the four-state branch to
--    the two real sources — an active trial, or a plain assignment.
